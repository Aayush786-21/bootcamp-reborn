Task: Package Management

Update your package index

Install htop (system monitoring tool)

Check if nginx is installed. If not, list the command you would use to install it (DON'T actually install if you don't have sudo)

List all currently installed packages and save the output to ~/devops-lab/packages.txt

Deliverable:
• Screenshot of package update and htop installation
• Text file with installed packages list
