# SDLC: Waterfall, Agile & DevOps

## 1. What SDLC Means
SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) describes the end-to-end process of creating and running software.

**Typical stages:**  
Requirements → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance

---

## 2. Waterfall Model
**Concept:** Work moves forward in a single straight line, finishing one phase before starting the next.

**Sequence:**  
Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Release → Support

**Characteristics:**
- Highly structured and sequential  
- Heavy emphasis on documentation  
- Assumes requirements are stable from the beginning  

**Advantages:**
- Easy to understand and manage  
- Works well for predictable, strict environments  

**Limitations:**
- Changes are expensive and slow  
- Testing happens late  
- Users don’t see progress until the final stage  

---

## 3. Agile Model
**Concept:** Build and improve software in short cycles with regular feedback.

**Typical Scrum Flow:**  
Product Backlog → Sprint Planning → Sprint Work (Design + Code + Test) → Sprint Review → Retrospective

**Characteristics:**
- Iterative and incremental  
- Welcomes evolving requirements  
- Encourages continuous communication with stakeholders  

**Advantages:**
- Frequent usable output  
- Fast response to new ideas or issues  
- Early validation of features  

**Limitations:**
- Requires an engaged customer  
- Less upfront detail  
- Harder to estimate long-term cost and timeline

## 4. Waterfall vs Agile

| Aspect          | Waterfall           | Agile                     |
|----------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Workflow       | Linear               | Cyclic                    |
| Flexibility    | Low                  | High                      |
| Customer Input | Mostly at the start  | Throughout the process    |
| Testing        | After development    | Built into every cycle    |
| Delivery       | Single release       | Frequent small releases   |

## 5. DevOps
DevOps combines culture, methods, and tooling to streamline software delivery and operations.

**Usually paired with:** Agile

**Key Principles:**
- Development and Operations collaborate closely  
- Heavy use of automation  
- Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery  
- Monitoring and feedback from real systems  

**Lifecycle:**  
Plan → Code → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor → Plan again

**Tool Categories:**
- Source control (Git)  
- CI/CD platforms  
- Containers and orchestration tools  
- Observability systems (metrics, logs, alerts)

---

## 6. How They Fit Together
- **Waterfall:** Predictable and structured, suited for stable requirements  
- **Agile:** Flexible way to manage work and deliver features continuously  
- **DevOps:** Operational and delivery approach that enhances Agile practices  

**Modern teams commonly use:** Agile + DevOps + Automated CI/CD
