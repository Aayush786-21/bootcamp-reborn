Part 1: Linux Command Line Basics

Using a Linux terminal (VM, WSL, or cloud instance):

• Create the following directory structure:

~/devops-lab/
├── projects/
│   ├── app1/
│   └── app2/
├── configs/
└── logs/


• Navigate to ~/devops-lab/projects/app1/ and create a file called README.md
• Copy README.md to app2/ directory
• List all files in ~/devops-lab/ recursively showing hidden files

Deliverable:
